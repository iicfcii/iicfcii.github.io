# Tinkerings

I enjoy tinkering with technology. Here are some of my cool and fun personal projects. 

## MagiDraw

This project converts drawings into interactive AR games. It is written in Python and OpenCV. It uses constrained Delaunay triangulation to create a mesh of triangles that can be bonded to the provided skeleton. The bonding weights of the triangles are automatically calculated based on the A* algorithm. Animating the drawing involves warping the triangles based on the weighted movement from the skeleton. Making my own drawings move and interacting with them is quite fascinating. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/iicfcii/magi-draw).
