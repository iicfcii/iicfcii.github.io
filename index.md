<img class="floating-right-image" width="200" src="/assets/img/self.jpg">

I'm currently a Robotics PhD student in the Integrating Design, Engineering, and Analysis (IDEA) Lab led by Professor Dan Aukes at Arizona State University (ASU) (01/2021 - Present). I received my Master and Bachelor's degrees in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechic Institue (WPI) (08/2012 - 12/2017). During that time, I was also a research assistant in the WPI Soft Robotics Lab run by Professor Cagdas Onal. Before my PhD, I cofounded a startup company called Orimagi, where I was in charge of the development and production of an educational origami robot kit. 

My research focuses on the development of novel design and fabrication methods for affordable and accesible origami and soft robots. These robots excel at tasks where cost, compliance, and safety are priorities instead of precision and power. Studies of them also help us better balance rigidity and softness of robots for different applications.

In IDEALab, I am currently developing simulation models and fabrication pipelines to enable tuning and optimizations of dynamic laminate robots made from low-cost and compliant materials. The core of the robots are multi-layer, multi-material laminates that are cut, folded, and locked into three-dimensional mechanisms, providing desired motion and stiffness profiles.

At WPI, I developed a hierarchical process of designing a series of affordable legged and aerial robots folded from plastic sheets.

I also designed a series of bending and linear pneumatic soft actuators along with their fabrication processes. They are the building blocks of a soft snake robot and are also used to study soft robot control algorithms.

# <a name="startup"></a> Startup

In an attempt to bring origami robots to more people, I cofounded a startup company called Orimagi. With some seed funding from angel investors, we were able to develop an education origami robot kit for kids to learn about technolgy and unleash their creativity. The kit enables them to fold, assemble, and personalize their own origami robots. They can also remote control and even program the robots with a smart phone or tablet to carry out fun activities like racing, bowling, and roleplaying. We sold over a thousand of those kits in U.S. and China. Unfortunately, the company failed due to various reasons at the end. 

I was the only engineer in our small team so I had to learn and handle all the technical aspects of the product including all the mechanical parts, PCBs, firmware, App, and packaging. We made many iterations and I was involved in all the playtestings and events. I also worked with factories to certify and produce the products.
