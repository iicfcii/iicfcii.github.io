# About

<img class="floating-right-image" width="250" src="/assets/img/self.jpg">

I'm currently a Robotics PhD student in the Integrating Design, Engineering, and Analysis (IDEA) Lab led by Professor Dan Aukes at Arizona State University (ASU) (01/2021 - Present). I received my Master and Bachelor's degrees in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechic Institue (WPI) (08/2012 - 12/2017). During that time, I was also a research assistant in the WPI Soft Robotics Lab run by Professor Cagdas Onal. Before my PhD, I cofounded a startup company called Orimagi, where I was in charge of the development and production of an educational origami robot kit.

In IDEALab, I am currently developing simulation models and fabrication pipelines to enable tuning and optimizations of dynamic laminate robots made from low-cost and compliant materials. The core of the robots are multi-layer, multi-material laminates that are
cut, folded, and locked into three-dimensional mechanisms, providing desired motion and stiffness profiles.

At WPI, I developed a hierarchical process of designing a series of affordable legged and aerial robots folded from plastic sheets.
